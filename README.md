# Meow Todos
### Each step is broken into branches

## Day 1 
* Step-1 Header
* Step-2 MainSection
* Step-3 Redux Store
* Step-4 MapStatetoProps
* Step-5 MapStatetoDispatch 
### Stretch Goals
* Break out Header's input into it's own component TodoTextInput
  1. Should be able to clear input when addTodo is successful
  2. Input field should have auto focus
  3. Create an action to completed todo, it will take an id. 
  4. Now instead of a list item for out todo's we'll have a component called TodoItem that will render each of our todo's
  5.  Each TodoItem should have an input checkbox to call the completed todo action, and mark it as such in the component.

## Day 2
* Step-6 Todo Input Component
* Step-7 Mark Todo Completed with Reducer and Action
* Step-8 CSS Fixes for todoMVC
* Step-9 Delete Todo, Edit Todo in place
